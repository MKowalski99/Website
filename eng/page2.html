            <br>
            <p>
                Given the recent economic downturn following the still very ongoing COVID-19 pandemic it is of peak importance to keep Literature affordable and accessible to all members of our community. This Organization seeks to provide the community with readily accessible and easily affordable books and literature, as well as serve as a community hub, providing free programs for community members of all ages. We aspire to ensure every member of the community affordable books and literature as well as a good time and a good read.
Donations of used books from members of the community would be greatly appreciated and would allow us to further our goal of ensuring every member of the community can have access to Literature.
